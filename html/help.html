            1. The Red Letter - Black Letter function is currently only available for the partially edited chapters in the Twenty-Fist Century Version of the Bible. Other hapters and versions will eventually be able to use this functionality also, but not today. The Red Letter - Black Letter button is not visible for this functionality for the other versions, so the disappearing funcitionality buttons are not an error.
