            The Ark Bible is an open-source Bible application project, that can be freely distributed tby anyone and to anyone for use in spreading God's Holy word. There are some functionality differences between the versions of the Bible in this project, and part of this help file's job is to detail some of those differences.

            1. Local Storage - If you decide to let The Ark Bible store files locally, all the support files for the application will be stored locally in your browser cache. All the version files will also be stored locally as you change Bible versions. The first time you use a Bible version listed in the Versions menu it will require an internet connection, but once you have accessed that version for the first time, it will also be stored locally. Once saved all the html, css, and javascript files required by the app will be stored and any versions accessed with an active internet connection will be available offline for future use without an internet connection. After being saved locally the app will not require an internet connection, and it will operate much more efficiently. The Twenty First Century Version (TWF) of the Bible will be automatically updated on the 12th and the 28th of each month, to get the latest updates for the (TWF) version you must run the app on the 12th or the 28th of the month with an internet connection. Any updates to the app itself will be automatically updated any time you run the app with an internet connection.

            2. The Red Letter - Black Letter function is currently only available for the partially edited chapters in the Twenty-Fist Century Version of the Bible. Other chapters and versions will eventually be able to use this functionality also, but not today. The Red Letter - Black Letter button is not visible for this functionality for the other versions, so the disappearing funcitionality buttons are not an error.
