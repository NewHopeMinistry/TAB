            Short history of each version of the Bible in "The Ark Bible" project. A humble effort to preserve all versions of God's word. There are huge differences between each version of the Bible. I have found over 2,800 versions of the Bible in many different languages. The Bibles versions in "The Ark Bible" project are all in the Public Domain, their copyrights are either expired or they were placed in the Public Domain by their authors. The only exception is the "King James Version" which carries a perpetual copyright owned by the royal family of England in the United Kingdom. Most other countries do not recognize perpetual copyrights.

            Published: 1999
            <p>
                The American King James Version (AKJ) isn't a new translation, but a revision of the classic 1611 King James Version (KJV) by Michael Peter (Stone) Engelbrite. Released in 1999, the AKJV aimed to bridge the gap between the beautiful, but sometimes archaic, English of the KJV and the speech patterns of modern Americans. Engelbrite believed in staying faithful to the original meaning, so he focused on updating spellings and vocabulary rather than changing sentence structure or grammar. This kept the familiar and beloved style of the KJV while making it more accessible for contemporary readers. Engelbrite released the AKJ into the public domain, allowing anyone to freely copy, distribute, or even modify it, as long as the core message remained unchanged.

            Authors: Phillip Schaff and others.<br>
            Published: 1901
            <p>
                The American Standard Version (ASV) of the Bible, began in 1872 as a project to revise the 1611 King James Version. Phillip Schaff, assembled a team of 30 American and British scholars representing various Protestant denominations, and their efforts culminated in the publication of the revised New Testament in 1881 and the Old Testament in 1885, which was published in Great Britain as the Revised Version. However, the American scholars had suggested changes that were not included in the final British version. Consequently, they released their own version, the ASV, the New Testament was published in 1900 and the complete Bible in 1901. The ASV made use of the Westcott and Hort Greek New Testament and the Masoretic Text for the Old Testament, and it was the first major English translation to use "Jehovah" instead of God or Lord, as the Hebrew translation of YHWH. The ASV was popular at first, but it's archaic language limited its widespread adoption. It later served as the foundation for several 20th-century Bible translations, including the Revised Standard Version, the Amplified Bible, and the New American Standard Bible. Its commitment to a word-for-word translation philosophy has shaped modern Bible translations, balancing the need for literal accuracy with readability. Today, the ASV is in the public domain and it's freely available, and it continues to influence religious study and translation efforts.

            Authors: Richard Bancroft, and the archbishop of Canterbury, and 47 other scholars and clergy.<br>
            Published: 1611
            <p>
                The Authorized King James Version (AKV) began in early 17th century England, when King James I, authorized a new Bible translation to address religious controversies and solidify his own rule. Dozens of scholars spent years working on the project, drawing from existing English translations and ancient Greek and Hebrew texts. The resulting Authorized King James Version (AKV) was published in 1611. The AKV's beautiful and enduring language quickly gained popularity.  It became the standard English Bible for centuries, shaping not just religious practice but also literature and law.  Its influence on the English language is undeniable, introducing many phrases and expressions still in use today. The terms "Authorized King James Version" (AKV) and "King James Version" (KJV) are often used interchangeably. There are very subtle differences, technically: "Authorized King James Version" (AKV) is the most accurate term. King James never officially "authorized" the translation, though he did commission it. In practice: King James Version KJV typically refers to the 1769 edition, which saw minor revisions from the 1611 original, AKV might specifically reference the 1611 edition or editions very close to it. Overall: The differences between the AKV and the KJV are very minor, mostly punctuation or capitalization. Both refer to the core 1611 translation.

            Published: 2016
            <p>
                The Berean Standard Bible (BSB) is a modern translation of the Holy Scriptures that emerged from a commitment to clarity and fidelity to the original Hebrew and Greek texts. Published in 2016, the BSB was developed by a team of scholars associated with Bible Hub and the Discover Bible. This translation is unique in its approach, merging the Berean Literal Bible and the Berean Interlinear Bible to create a version that is both accurate to the original languages and accessible to the modern reader. The BSB's name is inspired by the noble-minded Bereans of Acts 17:11, who diligently examined the Scriptures. Emphasizing this spirit of inquiry, the BSB offers a transparent text that encourages study of the root meanings of words. It is available for free online, reflecting the publishers' belief that the Scriptures should be freely studied and shared. The BSB stands out for its balance between "word for word" and "thought for thought" translation philosophies, maintaining original gender designations and consistency with the core meanings of the source texts. As language evolves, so does the BSB, with its translation process remaining open to refinement to ensure continued relevance and accuracy.

            Published: 1941
            <p>
                The Bible in Basic English (BBE), first published in 1941, is a translation of the Bible into Basic English. It utilizes a 1,000-word vocabulary to help non-native English speakers and those with limited education. The New Testament was released in 1941, followed by the Old Testament in 1949. This translation was the work of S. H. Hooke and a team who sought to simplify the text while maintaining the original meanings. In 1965, the BBE was printed by Cambridge University Press and, due to the absence of a copyright notice, fell into the public domain in the United States. The BBE is noted for its clarity and simplicity, making the profound stories and teachings of the Bible accessible to a broader audience. It remains a valuable resource for introducing new readers to biblical narratives and concepts.

            Authors: Archbishop Matthew Parker and others.<br>
            Published: 1568
            <p>
                The Bishop's Bible (BBB), first published in 1568, was an English translation mandated by the Church of England to supplant the Geneva Bible, whose Calvinist-influenced annotations were deemed unsuitable by the Anglican clergy. Archbishop Matthew Parker spearheaded the project, which involved various bishops and scholars who each translated a section, identifiable by their initials in early editions. This translation was notably more formal and less accessible than its predecessor. Despite revisions in 1572, the BBB never achieved the popularity of the Geneva Bible. However, it significantly influenced the King James Version (KJV), with the 1602 edition of the Bishop's Bible serving as its base text. The KJV, completed in 1611, went on to become one of the most enduring and revered translations in the English-speaking world.
