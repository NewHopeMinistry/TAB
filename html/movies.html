        <h2 class="greenEmphasis">Faith Based Movies and Shows</h2>

        <p>
            This is a list of faith based movies and shows that I feel are inspired by the Holy Spirit. Whenever I watch these movies I see God's glory in my life and it strengthens my faith. Watching these movies and shows demonstrates God's abundance to me, and I can always find something from this list to lift my soul. Many of these movies and shows are supported by commercials, but I feel that God definitely played a role in the production of these stories.

            <p>
                This Biblical drama follows the life of Jesus Christ as depicted in the Gospel of Matthew. A very powerful testimony of the miracles, crucifixion, and death that the disciple Matthew recorded for us in the New Testament that lovingly displays the love of Jesus, and the sacrifice he and the father both made because they love us, and they want to save our souls from eternal damnation.

            Drama · 1999 · 1 hr 59 min · Rated: R<br>
            Starring: Ed Harris, Anne Heche, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Charles Haid, Michael Rispoli<br>
            Directed by: Agnieszka Holland
            <p>
                A priest who has lost his faith finds new purpose when the Vatican sends him to investigate a deceased woman's candidacy for sainthood. In Chicago, in 1979, Father Frank Shore (Ed Harris) is a priest, now a Postulator, who investigates claims of miracles for the Vatican performed by a devout woman whose death caused a statue of the Virgin Mary to bleed upon and cure a girl with terminal lupus. I have watched this movie many times, and every time I watch it, I can feel the presence of the Holy Spirit around my soul. Ed Harris plays the role of Father Frank Shore who is a man that anyone who has ever followed Jesus Christ will recognize, if their faith has ever been shaken by this mortal life.
