        <p>
            This is a list of faithful movies that I feel are inspired by the Holy Spirit, some more so than others. Whenever I watch these movies I see God's glory in my life and it strengthens my faith. When I watch these movies I see God's abundance, because I can always find something from this list to lift my soul. Jesus spoke of God's abundance in Matthew 10:23 when he said, "If people in one city persecute you, simply flee to another one, because I honestly say to you, that you will not go through all the cities of Israel before the Son of Man returns." While not all of these movies were produced as a statement of faith, some were and this demonstrates to me that God uses all types of people for his purposes. Many of them are supported by commercials, but I feel that God definitely played a role in their production.

                During the Second World War, a group of Allied sailors board an old warship to transfer an infantry battalion to various parts of the Pacific. The Holy Spirit revealed to me that this movie is a parable of why God gave us our savior Jesus and why he created naval commanders, sailboats, and Christians. Someone has to take the blame.

                This Biblical drama follows the life of Jesus Christ as depicted in the Gospel of Matthew. A very powerful testimony of the miracles, crucifixion, and death that the disciple Matthew recorded for us in the New Testament that lovingly displays the love of Jesus, and the sacrifice he and the father both made because they love us, and they want to save our souls from eternal damnation.

            Directed by: Agnieszka Holland
            <p>
                A priest who has lost his faith finds new purpose when the Vatican sends him to investigate a deceased woman's candidacy for sainthood. In Chicago, in 1979, Father Frank Shore (Ed Harris) is a priest, now a Postulator, who investigates claims of miracles for the Vatican performed by a devout woman whose death caused a statue of the Virgin Mary to bleed upon and cure a girl with terminal lupus. I have watched this movie many times, and every time I watch it, I can feel the presence of the Holy Spirit around my soul. Ed Harris plays the role of Father Frank Shore who is a man that anyone who has ever followed Jesus Christ will recognize, if their faith has ever been shaken by this mortal life.

                A Bible scholar living in 1890 climbs aboard a time machine to see how the book he wrote will affect future generations and is stunned by the results. Beleive it or not, this science fiction time travel adventure is seriously spiritual, and displays God in all his glory. It allowed me to see "The end of the age" that Jesus spoke of in a whole new light.
