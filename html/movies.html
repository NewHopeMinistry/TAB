        <h2 class="cs-movieContents">Faith Based Movies and Shows</h2>
        <p>
            This is a list of faith based movies and shows that I feel are inspired by the Holy Spirit. Whenever I watch these movies I see God's glory in my life and it strengthens my faith. Watching these movies and shows demonstrates God's abundance to me, and I can always find something from this list to lift my soul. Many of these movies and shows are supported by commercials, but I feel that God definitely played a role in the production of these stories.

What they don't realize is that he has come to help them and the residents of Promise. No one knows who he is or where he came from. Some think he's an answer to prayer. Others think he's a runaway or a false prophet. And the only thing this boy will say about himself is that he's here to help. The town's sheriff, Brody, is determined to uncover the truth. But Brody has his own problems trying to hold a dying town together. Miracle after miracle takes place and the residents of Promise embrace the boy. But when the beloved town doctor dies, it is time for the truth to be revealed. The boy pleads with Brody in front of the whole town to believe that he's come to help, not to hurt anyone.

            <p>
                This Biblical drama follows the life of Jesus Christ as depicted in the Gospel of Matthew. A very powerful testimony of the miracles, crucifixion, and death that the disciple Matthew recorded for us in the New Testament that lovingly displays the love of Jesus, and the sacrifice he and the father both made because they love us, and they want to save our souls from eternal damnation.

            Drama · 1999 · 1 hr 59 min · Rated: R<br>
            Starring: Ed Harris, Anne Heche, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Charles Haid, Michael Rispoli<br>
            Directed by: Agnieszka Holland
            <p>
                A priest who has lost his faith finds new purpose when the Vatican sends him to investigate a deceased woman's candidacy for sainthood. In Chicago, in 1979, Father Frank Shore (Ed Harris) is a priest, now a Postulator, who investigates claims of miracles for the Vatican performed by a devout woman whose death caused a statue of the Virgin Mary to bleed upon and cure a girl with terminal lupus. I have watched this movie many times, and every time I watch it, I can feel the presence of the Holy Spirit around my soul. Ed Harris plays the role of Father Frank Shore who is a man that anyone who has ever followed Jesus Christ will recognize, if their faith has ever been shaken by this mortal life.

            <p>
                A Bible scholar living in 1890 climbs aboard a time machine to see how the book he wrote will affect future generations and is stunned by the results. Beleive it or not, this science fiction time travel adventure is seriously spiritual, and displays God in all his glory. It allowed me to see "The end of the age" that Jesus spoke of in a whole new light
