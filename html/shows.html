            This is a list of faithful TV shows that I feel are inspired by the Holy Spirit, some more so than others. Whenever I watch these shows I see God's glory in my life and it strengthens my faith. When I watch these shows I see God's abundance, because I can always find something from this list to lift my soul. Jesus spoke of God's abundance in <a class="cs-showTitle cs-underline" href="https://thearkbible.com/?bid=40&cn=10&verid=21&vh=23" target="_blank" title="Read - Matthew 10:23">Matthew 10:23</a> when he said, "If people in one city persecute you, simply flee to another one, because I honestly say to you, that you will not go through all the cities of Israel before the Son of Man returns." While not all of these shows were produced as a statement of faith, some were and this demonstrates to me that God uses all types of people for his purposes. While many of them are supported by commercials, I definitely feel that God played a role in their production.
