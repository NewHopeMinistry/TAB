            <h3>About The Twenty-First Century Version (TWF)</h3>
            <br>
            Work on the Twenty-First Century Version (TWF) was begun in 2018, shortly after an extended stay in the hospital, and I feel very strongly that God called me to this work. The Holy Spirit is my guiding light in this endeavor, and has revealed to me that God wants a new scripture with a much softer and more forgiving tone than the traditional Scriptures. This is not a word for word Bible translation, it's my interpretation of what the Bible says, and a faithful interpretation of what the Holy Spirit is saying to me. Each verse is analyzed for what it's truly trying to say, and is rewritten in such a way that I can understand it. It's a
            translation for me, and for you, if you want it. I use modern 21st. century English, grammar spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure. The foundation for this translation is the King James Version (KJV), which I find very confusing and difficult to read and understand. There is a lot of redundancy and repetion within the verses of the old texts, and I have tried to proplerly structure the sentences so that run-on sentences, sentences that say the same thing over and over again are properly structured for modern readers. I am restructuring the sentences by positioning the nouns, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, adjecitives, modifiers, and descriptors in the proper order for college level English grammar in the 21st. century.
