        <h3>About The Twenty-First Century Version (TWF)</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        A friend once asked me if I thought it was a good idea for twenty first century scientists to clone dinosauers and bring them back to life from ancient DNA samples, just because they could. God has recently given me the answer to that riddle. The answer is, NO - So, work on the Twenty-First Century Version (TWF) of the Bible was begun in 2018, shortly after an extended stay in the hospital, and I feel very strongly that God called me to this work. The Holy Spirit is my guiding light in this endeavor, and has revealed to me that God wants a new scripture with a much softer and more forgiving tone than the traditional Scriptures. The foundation for this version is the King James Version, but I have found it to be a flawed translation as is all human endeavors. In areas where the King James seem to be incomplete or irrational, I have compared it to other more modern translations, some of which have been translated from earlier Greek and Hebrew texts, that have been discovered since 1901. This is not a word for word Bible translation, it's my interpretation of what the Bible says, and a faithful interpretation of what the Holy Spirit is saying to me. Each verse is analyzed for what it's truly trying to say, and is rewritten in such a way that I can understand it. It's a translation for me, and for you, if you want it. I use modern 21st. century English, grammar spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure. The foundation for this translation is the King James Version (KJV), which I find very confusing and difficult to read and understand. There is a lot of redundancy and repetion within the verses of the old texts, and I have tried to proplerly structure the sentences so that run-on sentences, sentences that say the same thing over and over again are properly structured for modern readers. I am restructuring the sentences by positioning the nouns, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, adjecitives, modifiers, and descriptors in the proper order for college level English grammar in the 21st. century.
        <br><br>
        I have done a lot of praying over The Twenty-First Century Version of the Bible!
        <br><br>
        Thank You God! I hope this work brings glory to your name!
